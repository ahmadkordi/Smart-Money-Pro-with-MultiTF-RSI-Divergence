# Smart-Money-Pro-with-MultiTF-RSI-Divergence
A Professional TradingView Indicator for Crypto Trading

Strengths of the "Smart Money Pro with MultiTF RSI & Divergence" Indicator
1. Flexible Customization
Users can adjust critical parameters like:

Swing Length for high/low detection

ATR Period and Multiplier for volatility filtering

Volume Threshold to filter low-validity signals

Customizable RSI levels for overbought/oversold conditions

2. Multi-Indicator Confirmation
Combines RSI, ATR, Volume, and Price Swings to generate high-probability signals.

Requires confluence of:

Breakouts + High Volume + RSI Confirmation + Low Volatility (via ATR).

3. Smart Divergence Detection
Identifies bullish/bearish divergences between price and RSI.

Tracks previous swing highs/lows and their corresponding RSI values for accurate detection.

4. Multi-Timeframe RSI Analysis
Displays RSI values across 6 timeframes (1m to 4h) in a real-time table.

Helps traders assess trend strength across different time horizons.

5. Clear Visual Signals
Uses colored triangles (▲/▼) and text labels for intuitive signal recognition.

Optional toggles for signals, swings, and labels to reduce chart clutter.

6. Advanced Filters
Volume Filter: Only triggers signals when volume exceeds the moving average.

Volatility Filter: Avoids false breakouts during high ATR periods.

7. Optimized Performance
Limits max_lines_count and max_labels_count to prevent overload.

Updates the RSI table every 5 bars to reduce CPU usage.

8. Professional Design
Clean color scheme (green for buys, red for sells) with transparency settings.

Strategic label placement (above/below bars) for readability.

9. Easy Extensibility
Modular code structure allows adding features like:

Candlestick pattern recognition

Fibonacci-based targets

Custom alert conditions

Why This Stands Out:

This indicator is not just another RSI tool – it’s a sophisticated trading system that:

✔ Reduces false signals with multi-layered confirmation.

✔ Saves time by analyzing multiple timeframes in one pane.

✔ Works seamlessly for crypto, forex, and stocks.
